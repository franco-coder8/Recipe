            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter or cooking oil</li>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs and milk together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Heat butter or oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until melted and hot.</li>
                <li>Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, swirling it around to cover the bottom evenly.</li>
                <li>As the edges set, gently lift them with a spatula, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow underneath.</li>
                <li>Once the omelette is mostly set but still slightly runny on top, add your chosen filling on one side of the omelette.</li>
                <li>Fold the other side of the omelette over the filling, creating a half-moon shape.</li>
                <li>Cook for an additional minute or until the omelette is fully set and the filling is heated through.</li>
                <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate, garnish with fresh herbs if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
